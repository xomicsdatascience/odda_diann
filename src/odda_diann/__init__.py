--about display information with basic links and notices for this DIA-NN version
--aff M:K-N (Enteprise version) attempt to set the CPU affinity of the main thread to logical core M and all other threads to logical cores K to N (core indices start with 0); consider using --aff when (i) running DIA-NN on NUMA HPC systems or (ii) running multiple DIA-NN analyses in parallel
--auto-aff (Enteprise version) attempt to automatically set thread affinities to spread CPU threads over logical CPU cores, first assigning to cores with even indices (starting with 0), to avoid placing two threads on a single physical core; this setting may be highly beneficial in particular on Windows systems with > 64 logical cores in a single CPU. On NUMA HPC systems, consider using --aff instead; when using --auto-aff, do not run any other DIA-NN analyses in parallel on the same PC
--cal [N] set the calibration mode, valid values are 0 (off), 1, 3, 5 and 7, default is 7
--cal-channel [channel name] specifies which channel to use for calibration: if there is a channel that is expected to produce good identification numbers in all samples, use this command to possibly improve calibration
--cfg [file name] specifies a file to load options/commands from
--channel-run-norm normalisation of multiplexed samples will be performed in run-specific manner, i.e. to perform normalisation, for each precursor ion DIA-NN will sum the respective channels within each run and will normalise these sums across runs: use e.g. for protein turnover SILAC experiments
--channel-spec-norm normalisation of multiplexed samples will be performed in channel-specific manner, i.e. each channel in each run is treated as a separate sample to be normalised: use to analyse experiments wherein multiplexing of independent samples is used to boost throughput
--channels [channel 1]; [channel 2]; ... lists multiplexing channels, wherein each channel declaration has the form [channel] = [label group],[channel name],[sites],[mass1:mass2:...], wherein [sites] has the same syntax as for --var-mod and if N sites are listed, N masses are listed at the end of the channel declaration. The spectral library will be automatically split into multiple channels, for precursors bearing the [label group] modification. To add the latter to a label-free spectral library, can use --lib-fixed-mod, e.g. --fixed-mod SILAC,0.0,KR,label --lib-fixed-mod SILAC. See Multiplexing using plexDIA for usage examples. Currently, [label group] must be the same for all channels and the channels must be listed in such an order that the channel mass shifts are non-decreasing for each modification site.
